# Conv-TabNet
## Project Overview
This project is an adaptive color correction network for smartphone camera-based urine component analysis, based on convolutional neural networks and tabular neural networks.

## File Description

This project contains the following five Python files:

* Conv-TabNet.py
* TabResnet.py
* XGBoost.py
* detect.py
* forest.py

There is also a folder named "model", which contains the following two model files:

* Model_conv.zip
* Model_tabnet.zip

The folder also contains two subfolders named "forest" and "tree", which respectively store trained random forest models and decision tree models.

## Usage

You can use these Python scripts to perform urine component analysis with smartphone cameras. Here is a brief overview of the purpose of each script:

* Conv-TabNet.py: implements the adaptive color correction network.
* TabResnet.py: implements the tabular neural network.
* XGBoost.py: implements the gradient boosting tree model.
* detect.py: implements the urine component analysis.
* forest.py: implements the random forest model.
* Model_conv.zip and Model_tabnet.zip: contain the trained Conv-TabNet model and tabular neural network model.
* forest and tree folders: contain the trained random forest models and decision tree models.

If you want to use these scripts for urine component analysis, you can download these files to your local computer and run them using Python. Please refer to the comments and documentation in each script for specific usage instructions.
